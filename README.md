## Description

_This was a homework assignment for Epicodus. We practiced modifying strings and writing functions. Enter a sentence in the prompt, then to see your sentence, click on the good dog. To see the jumbled sentence, click the bad dog (be careful, he bites!)._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _git clone this repository to test it out yourself_
